            <h4>Detecting Malariya with Deep Learning using Blood Smears | Kaggle</h4>

            The project's objective was to replace the method of detection of Malariya from manual diagnosis to an automated diagnosis using Deep Learning. Here I have created a CNN from scratch using tensorflow along with the use of some Image processing techniques such as resize, rotate, blur etc. to increase the efficiency of the model over the data-set. The data-set is available <a href="https://ceb.nlm.nih.gov/proj/malaria/cell_images.zip"><b>here</b></a>. The Project code is available <a href="https://github.com/saranshqm/Detection-of-Malariya-using-blood-smears"><b>here</b></a>.

            <h4>Development of a virtual reality based fire training simulator and machine learning based path guidance system: A case of
hospital fire breakouts | Dr. J. Maiti | Industrial and Systems Engineering | IIT Kharagpur | Duration: 15/05/2019 - 30/06/2019</h4>

     Created a <b>virtual environment</b> of a hospital building with a fire in <b>Unity3D</b>, tested in oculus-rift to collect data from human behavior in case of fire. Implemented a <b>Reinforcement Learning-based </b> approach on train data from human behavior to bail out of the fire and show the best path. The methodology behind the research can be used for safe evacuation and suggesting new emergency exits from a building in case of fire. Report is available <a href="Hospital Fire Report.pdf"> here</a> and the project certificate is available <a href = "images/PROJECT CERTIFICATE.jpg">here</a>.

     <b> Achievements of this project:</b>
     <li> Appreciated and encouraged for the research work done by the <b>Ministry of Human Resource Development of India</b> on 3 August 2019.</li>
     <li> <b>Accepted</b> for presentation at the <b>2nd International Conference on Human Interaction & Emerging Technologies: Future Applications (IHIET-AI 2020)</b> to be held at Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois (CHUV), Lausanne, Switzerland, April 23-25, 2020. (cancelled later on due to COVID-19)</li>

            <h4>Data Analytics and the Machine Learning model to predict the type of Network Congestion | The Annual Inter-hall Technology General
Championship | Data Analytics Event | Technology Students Gymkhana | IIT Kharagpur</h4>

            <li> Created a Machine Learning model to predict the type of Network Congestion at a particular area and the particular time using various boosting techniques such as XGBOOST, optimized the models with grid search and bayesian optimization. Visualized variaous correlations and features for the ffeature engineering.</li>
            <li> Obtained 82.55% train accuracy, 80.66% test accuracy, MCC score of 0.742.</li>
            <li> Our Team stood at 1st position based on the MCC score obtained and overall 3rd position out of all participating teams. Awarded with
BRONZE for the Inter-Hall Data-Analytics General Championship organized by The Technology Students Gymkhana, IIT Kharagpur.</li>
