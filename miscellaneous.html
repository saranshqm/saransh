            <h2>Work Experience:</h2>
            <h3> COVID-19 Decision Support System Intern at | <a href = "https://www.sapioanalytics.com/covid-19-decision-support-system/">Sapio Analytics</a>, India | May, 2020 to July 2020</h3>
             <h4>I am working  as a python backend and Machine Learning Intern with a team of around 150 data-scientists accross India to obtain the following outputs:</h4>
             <li>Prediction of spread</li>
           <li>Resource optimization of essential services</li>
             <li>Predicting the impact on the economy</li>
             <li>Predicting the social impact of the outbreak</li>
             <li>Planning structured withdrawal of lockdown</li>
             <li>Preparation of algorithm for alternative testing methodology</li>
             <p>We have been applying AI into the above problems to combat with COVID-19 and helping <b>The Govt. of India</b> to take decisions.</p>
             </br>
     
         <h3>National Institutes of Biomedical Innovation, Health and Nutrition (NIBIOHN), Osaka, Japan</h3>
               <h4>Remote Machine Learning researcher, collaborator working under <a href = "https://mizuguchilab.org/members/kenji-mizuguchi/">Prof. Kenji Mizuguchi and Prof. Tripathi</a></h4>
                    <li>We have been collaborating with an objective to present some AI solutions for the prediction of Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) using gene expression data which is a very common type of lung cancer, found in around 85% of all lung cancers. </li>
                    <li>Further we extend our work to present those key important factors/genes which are mainly responsible for this type of cancer.</li>
                <p>I have gained expirience in Genomics, and application of AI in genomics, the learning is still going on!
                     </br>
                     <b>Note:</b> The data-set is highly confidential, but I would be more than happy to discuss more on the methodologies used, please contact me on: <b>saransh.official.iitkgp@gmail.com</b> for any discussion or suggestion.</p>

             <h3>Swaayatt Robots (स्वायत्त रोबोट्स), India | April, 2020 to June 2020</h3>
                <h4>Deep Learning & Computer vision summer Intern working under Mr. Sanjiv Sharma, CEO, Swaayatt Robots.</h4>
             <li>Worked with large data-sets of images to build a pipeline which can automate the points tracking, segments the road to extract path</li>
             <li>Programmed SuperPoint algorithm, a deep learning approach to extract features of an image for Point tracking & Visual Odometry.</li>
             <li>Trained & tested the Linear Style Transfer algorithm using tensorflow and deep learning to change the semantics of the road and convert day to night, night to day etc. in images.</li>
             <li>Incorporated Visual Odometry, Point tracking and style transfer into a single pipeline to directly deploy on the system.</li>
     <p>I have gained a lot of programming expirience with python, along with a depth knowledge of Computer-Vision and Deep Learning.</p>
     
     </br>
            <h3>Safety Analytics & Virtual Reality, Industrial & Systems Engineering, IIT Kharagpur, India</h3>

                <h4>Undergraduate Research Assistant worked under <a href="http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/department/IM/faculty/im-jmaiti">Prof. J. Maiti</a></h4>
     <li>Worked on the Development of a virtual reality based fire training simulator and Machine Learning based path guidance system
with an objective to build a virtual environment to train people for safe evacuation from a hospital building in case of fire.</li>
     <li> Created virtual environment of a building in Unity3D, tested in oculus-rift to collect data from human behavior in case of fire.</li>
          <li>Programmed the oculus rift player along with the AI-Bots which will follow the player during the time of fire exit using C#.</li>
         <p>I have gained a lot of programming, designing expirience along with a unique expirience of Virtual Reality and Game Development!</p>
